        Yes, Yes, without the oops! Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really
        exist? I was part of something special. Life finds a way. Did he just
        throw my cat out of the window? Must go faster. We gotta burn the rain
        forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! Cause
        maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they wont want it anymore! I
        was part of something special. Hey, take a look at the earthlings.
        Goodbye! Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. God creates
        dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God.
        Man creates Dinosaurs. Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go!
        Checkmate... This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining
        bucket seats, and... power windows. So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs?
        Just my luck, no ice. This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio,
        reclining bucket seats, and... power windows. I gave it a cold? I gave
        it a virus. A computer virus. Remind me to thank John for a lovely
        weekend. God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man.
        Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. Yeah, but your scientists were
        so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didnt stop to think
        if they should.

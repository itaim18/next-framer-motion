title: "One day in october🎗"
abstract: October 7th was a turning point that set the tone for the following months. The sudden call to arms, the immediate danger, and the responsibility I felt reshaped my priorities and perspective. This day marked the beginning of a challenging journey, impacting every subsequent month in profound ways. It tested my resilience, altered my daily life, and defined my actions and thoughts in ways I never anticipated. The experiences from that day onwards have been a constant reminder of the fragility of peace and the importance of vigilance and courage.

## October 5th:

I am returning from Italy where I discovered a lifelong hobby—Via Ferrata climbing 🧗‍♂️. I also realized that doing interviews during breaks can end terribly 💼.
The assignment was pretty standard, almost plain simple and expected 📄.
But being on a vacation high got me pretty low 🏞️.
Here’s a sample code that reminds the goals and questions based on that could be like:

This very day, I drove up with my family to Corni di Canzo near the Bellagio mountains for my first via ferrata track 🚗🏔️.
I fell in love immediately and instantly felt better ❤️‍🔥.
Two days later, we went back for “Simchat Torah” as we wanted to spend it in Israel 🇮🇱.

## **October 7th 🎗:**

Waking up to the call of sirens is not something I should be too surprised about 🚨.I go to shul expecting everything to be normal 🕍. I am not holding my phone but in a matter of minutes, everyone is equipped and ready to protect themselves and their loved ones. I quickly understand I need to be around all my family members since I am the only adult male in the family at the moment. Being a combat soldier, I feel doomed to serve as a personal guard for the day and the day after 🪖. It’s Shabbat. It’s a holiday. And my phone doesn’t stop ringing 📞. I pick it up after the 6th call. I am being recruited to the south. The whole situation is still too vague for me, and it seems like it was still vague for the rest of the world 🌍.We go back to our house, wanting to help. My mother stops me at the last minute: "Nadav was taken hostage…"We watch the news the whole night long 📺.Thinking about my cousin paralyzes me 🧠.Later, we see on the news that he should be fine. Getting a call from our uncle’s friend, we get the first sigh we had for 24 hours 📞.

## October 8th-02:30

I finally go to my unit, meeting all my new friends. I don’t know most of them. Never met them. They will probably see me in my most extreme times, and I know I will trust them with all my heart and hope they could trust me too 🤝.

## October 9th:

The tragic events start to show light. A person I was introduced to more than once was at the Nova party and was murdered. A sergeant that I was under his command fell in combat ⚔️. The horrors that happened to people I never knew seemed to make me feel as if I could spend the rest of my life with them if not for what happened.
I felt terrible that we were part of an attack command in the north and not in Gaza. At the time, I felt I was destined to protect the people that were hurt the most two days ago 🛡️.

## November:

We start doing the most important missions. We find terrorists. Destroy terror bases. Move forward with tanks. Hide in houses. Infiltrate houses that were found with ammunition, etc. 🚀
This goes on for a while and my food reduces to canned vegetables and some bread 🍞.

> Can you see the change I had?

## December:

We go out for 2 days. But we are only permitted to be in a hotel in Ashkelon. My parents visit for one hour. Later that day, we go back to Gaza. Though I should feel weaker than ever, I am strengthened looking at my siblings and thinking how I could never let anyone do to them what was done in October to people from my nation—my own brothers, sisters, grandparents, and babies 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦.

**2024**

## End of January:

We get one day of treatment when we talk about all we have done and seen. I talk loudly about how the streets will never look the same and how I felt better being in Gaza knowing I could make more effort there, knowing I can save people at home. Most of them disagree with me. One understands; he tells me that only when all are out for lunch. He leaves too and tells me to join. “I’m going out soon,” he says, wiping off a tear 😢.

## February:

I get a call from my sergeant. He tells me he has a job offer for me at the government as a data engineer. I didn’t think about a job at all. I made some bucks at IDF and didn’t feel ready, but I took the chance anyway 📞.
After taking the interview, I was required to do their assignment and pass on to more interviews. Eventually, I got hired. But only for a couple of weeks because of governmental bureaucracy 😩.

## March:

I stopped thinking about data developing with SQL, React graph libraries, etc. Going back to taking the time to relax, I started relaxing and kept developing with AI and React. How I love it 💻.

## April:

I did a small project for a startup but went back to vacay mode, climbing more on via ferrata in Israel at a special track named after Chagit, a climber who was murdered by the terrible terrorists of Hamas. Later, I relaxed at Eilat and even saw the views of Paris and the Gardens of Versailles 🌴✈️. THIS IS GREAT.

I am called back to reserve in Gaza.

## May:

People around me get hurt. Operations are getting more precise, the danger enlarges. I am scared. I am mute and feel terrible to share this 😟.

## June:

I try my best to communicate my fears while keeping the mission on. I take the time to process my thoughts and overcome my fears just until this round ends. Fortunately, this ended yesterday, fully knowing the day I come back is not far but having the four hostages back home is giving me more strength to keep on going 💪.

## July:

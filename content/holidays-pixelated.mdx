## Introduction

Icons and featured elements can add visual appeal and context to your blog posts.
For a 'Jewish Holidays' blog/landing page, we want to create unique and eye-catching pixelated
React nodes that capture the essence and importance of the jewish holidays for us.

Incorporating custom visuals can make your app stand out and provide a more immersive experience for your readers. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of creating pixelated React nodes and use it for icons, games and hero components step by step.

## Getting Started

To begin, make sure you have a React project set up. If you don't, you can create a new one using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) or a [meta-framework of your choice](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app).

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

You'll need to install the "react-pixelate" package in order to create pixelated React nodes.

```bash
npm install react-pixelate
```

{/* <Warning text="you can use other other package managers" /> */}

This dependency will allow you to use this library and control the pixel rate along with background centering etc.

### Step 2: Create a Pixelated Component

Let's dive into the technical aspects of creating pixelated React nodes. We'll start by crafting a reusable React component for pixelation.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { ImagePixelated } from "react-pixelate";
import { shofar } from "./constants.js";
export default function PixelatedShofar() {
  return (
    <ImagePixelated
      pixelSize={5}
      fillTransparencyColor="transparent"
      src={shofar}
      width={120}
      height={120}
    />
  );
}
```

This code defines a React component named _PixelatedShofar_ that renders an image of a **[Shofar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shofar)** with pixelated styling. You can adjust the width, height, and the background color along with centering to match your specific design requirements.

### step 3: Using the Pixelated React Node

Now that you have your pixelation component ready, let's incorporate it into your 'Jewish Holidays' blog:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import PixelatedShofar from './PixelatedShofar';

function BlogPost() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Ever blew that?üé∂</h2>
      <PixelatedShofar />
      <!-- Add more pixelated images here -->
    </div>
  );
}

export default BlogPost;
```

In this section, you'll integrate the `PixelatedImage` component into your blog post, creating pixelated icons or featured elements related to 'Jewish Holidays.' Feel free to include multiple images to make your blog visually engaging.

## Game on üïπÔ∏è‚Äã

Okay, I like thisü§©‚Äã. This game charged a lot; from handling different states using forms,data our great new library along with a different one called **[react-otp-input](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-otp-input)** all the way to working on styling.
In the process I wasn't sure if to go with a \*\*(wordle)[https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html] vibe or a generic web quiz vibe but while working on its logic I got a [new achievment badge](https://github.com/itaim18?achievement=galaxy-brain&tab=achievements) from github and the unique style of the badge's popover inspired my styling process.

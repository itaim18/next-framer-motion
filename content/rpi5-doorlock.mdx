In this post, we'll take you through our journey of building a secure door lock system powered by the Raspberry Pi 5. Leveraging embedded deep learning, an AI camera module, and a full-stack application, we‚Äôve created a robust, real-time face recognition system that controls door access.

## Introduction ü§ñ

The goal of this project is to create a **secure door lock** that only grants access when an authorized face is detected. Built on the **Raspberry Pi 5** and powered by advanced deep learning techniques, our system not only secures your entryway but also delivers an engaging, real-time experience. Imagine this: the moment the camera sees your face, the door unlocks. That‚Äôs the big ‚Äúwow‚Äù moment!

## Hardware Setup üõ†Ô∏è

Our configuration revolves around the **Raspberry Pi 5** paired with an **AI-optimized camera module**. Key components include:

- **Raspberry Pi 5** ‚Äì Main processing unit. üíª
- **AI Camera Module** ‚Äì Captures real-time video and images (IMX500-compatible models supported). üì∏
- **5V Relay Module** ‚Äì Controlled via GPIO, it toggles power for the lock.
- **12V Electric Strike** ‚Äì The locking mechanism that disengages when powered. üîí
- **12V AC-DC Adapter** ‚Äì Powers the electric strike.
- **(Optional) Servo** ‚Äì An alternative mechanical lock mechanism.

**Wiring & Fritzing Diagram:**

1. **Relay & Electric Strike:**

   - Connect **COM** and **NO/NC** pins of the relay to the electric strike.
   - Power the strike using the **12V adapter**.
   - The relay coil is powered by the Pi‚Äôs **5V** and triggered via a **GPIO** pin (e.g., GPIO17).

2. **Servo Alternative:**
   - Replace the electric strike with a servo motor if preferred, with control signals still coming from a GPIO pin.

## Embedded Deep Learning & Face Recognition üß†

At the heart of our system is a highly optimized **face recognition** pipeline. We use **OpenCV** for detection and frameworks like **TensorFlow Lite** (or **PyTorch**) for recognition inference.

### Face Recognition Code Snippet

```python
import cv2

# Load the pre-trained face detection model
face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')

# Initialize camera
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.3, minNeighbors=5)

    for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
        # Draw rectangle around detected face
        cv2.rectangle(frame, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (255, 0, 0), 2)

        # TODO: Integrate face recognition logic here
        # If recognized -> Unlock door
        # If unknown -> Invoke YOLOv8 for delivery classification

    cv2.imshow('Face Recognition', frame)
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

## Delivery Classification with YOLOv8 üöö

For unknown faces, the system leverages a **YOLOv8** model to detect delivery-related objects (boxes, helmets, motorcycles, etc.). If such items are found, the visitor is flagged as a potential delivery person.

### Key Points:

- **Roboflow Integration:**  
  Manage and annotate your dataset easily on Roboflow. Upload frames (20 seconds before/after unknown face events) for ongoing model retraining.
- **IMX500 Export:**  
  For edge inference directly on the camera, export your YOLOv8 model to an **IMX500-compatible** format‚Äîreducing load on the Pi.

> **Note:** If your camera isn‚Äôt IMX500-compatible, you can run YOLOv8 on the Pi‚Äôs CPU or an attached accelerator (like Coral TPU).

---

## Full-Stack Integration (Node.js + React + MongoDB) üíªüì±

To manage door lock activities and live feeds, we developed a full-stack solution:

### Backend: Node.js

A simple **Node.js** server retrieves and serves entrance data from **MongoDB**:

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = 8000;

app.get("/api/entrance", (req, res) => {
  // Retrieve data from MongoDB
  res.json({ feed: "Live entrance feed data from door lock system" });
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

### Frontend: React Dashboard

Our **React** dashboard displays live door activity and camera feeds:

```tsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";

const EntranceFeed = () => {
  const [feed, setFeed] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("/api/entrance")
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((data) => setFeed(data.feed));
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="feed-container">
      <h2>Entrance Feed</h2>
      <p>{feed ? feed : "Loading entrance feed..."}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default EntranceFeed;
```

## Deployment & Troubleshooting ‚öôÔ∏è

Deploying an embedded deep learning application comes with its challenges. Here are some tips:

1. **Model Optimization:**  
   Use lightweight frameworks (like **TensorFlow Lite**) for faster inference. Consider **IMX500 exports** if supported by your camera.

2. **Hardware Checks:**  
   Ensure the wiring for the **5V relay** and **12V electric strike** is secure. For servo setups, make sure the power supply is adequate.

3. **Logging & Monitoring:**  
   Implement logging in both your Node.js and Python scripts to quickly diagnose any issues.

4. **Security Considerations:**
   - Keep your Node.js endpoints private or behind a firewall.
   - Use secure (HTTPS) connections if exposing your system online.

# RPI5-Door Lock with Face Recognition

In this post, we'll take you through our journey of building a secure door lock system powered by the Raspberry Pi 5. Leveraging embedded deep learning, an AI camera module, and a full-stack application, we’ve created a robust, real-time face recognition system that controls door access.

## Introduction

The goal of this project was to create a secure door lock that only grants access when an authorized face is detected. The system is built on the Raspberry Pi 5 and leverages advanced deep learning techniques optimized for embedded devices. In addition, we integrate the door lock system into a full-stack application that provides:

- **Real-time entrance feed:** Monitor the door access logs and live camera feed.
- **Live feed from AI camera:** Visual confirmation of face recognition events.

The project uses a combination of hardware prototyping (with Fritzing diagrams) and sophisticated software components, including Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow (or PyTorch), FastAPI, and React.

## Hardware Setup

Our hardware configuration is centered on the Raspberry Pi 5 paired with an AI-optimized camera module. Below is a summary of the components used:

- **Raspberry Pi 5** – The main processing unit.
- **AI Camera Module** – For capturing real-time video and images.
- **Electronic Door Lock** – Controlled via GPIO pins.
- **Fritzing Diagram** – Detailed wiring and connections for the setup.

### Fritzing Diagram

> **Tip:** Ensure all connections are secure and double-check the GPIO pin assignments before powering up.

## Embedded Deep Learning & Face Recognition

At the heart of the system is our face recognition model, optimized to run on the Raspberry Pi 5. We use a combination of OpenCV for image processing and a deep learning framework (TensorFlow Lite or PyTorch Mobile) to perform real-time inference.

### Code Snippet: Face Recognition with OpenCV

```python
import cv2

# Load the pre-trained face detection model
face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')

# Initialize camera
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.3, minNeighbors=5)

    for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
        # Draw rectangle around detected face
        cv2.rectangle(frame, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (255, 0, 0), 2)

    cv2.imshow('Face Recognition', frame)

    # Exit loop when 'q' key is pressed
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

Deep Learning Optimization
For deployment on the Raspberry Pi, we convert our model to a lightweight format using TensorFlow Lite. This ensures faster inference and lower power consumption.

## Full-Stack Integration

To manage and monitor door lock activities, we developed a full-stack application that integrates:

Backend: A FastAPI service that handles API requests and serves entrance feed data.
Frontend: A React dashboard for real-time monitoring and control.
Backend: FastAPI
Below is an example of our FastAPI endpoint serving the entrance feed:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/api/entrance")
def get_entrance_feed(): # Placeholder for actual feed data
return {"feed": "Live entrance feed data from door lock system"}

if **name** == '**main**':
import uvicorn
uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

Frontend: React Dashboard
Our React dashboard displays both the entrance logs and the live camera feed. Below is a simplified version of our React component:

```tsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";

const EntranceFeed = () => {
  const [feed, setFeed] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("/api/entrance")
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((data) => setFeed(data.feed));
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="feed-container">
      <h2>Entrance Feed</h2>
      <p>{feed ? feed : "Loading entrance feed..."}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default EntranceFeed;
```

For a full view of our dashboard components, check out the GitHub repository: GitHub Repository

Live Demo & UI Components
We’ve also created a series of UI components to provide a rich user experience. Below are placeholders for some of our custom components:

DoorLockDemo – A demo component that simulates the door lock mechanism.
FaceRecognitionDemo – A live demo showing the face recognition in action.
LiveFeed – Displays the real-time video feed from the AI camera.
EntranceFeed – Shows the current entrance feed from our FastAPI backend. Feel
free to interact with these components in our demo environment!

Deployment & Troubleshooting
Deploying an embedded deep learning application can be challenging. Here are a few tips:

### Performance:

Ensure that your model is optimized (using TensorFlow Lite or similar) to run efficiently on the Pi.

### Hardware:

Double-check all wiring against the Fritzing diagram. Loose connections can cause erratic behavior.

### Software:

Use logging extensively in both your FastAPI backend and your Python scripts to monitor system health and debug issues.
